# BioDiversityPark
Biodiversity park is a place where all the different kinds of life can be found in one area. It is an enrichment to our society as each of the organisms work  together in the ecosystem to sustain balance of nature.
But nowadays, many of the helpless beings are on the verge of extinction due to lack of healthy environment to live in.
Hence, we have come up with the concept of aiding the endangered species by providing them with proper habitats via a database system.
