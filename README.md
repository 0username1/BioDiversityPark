# BioDiversityPark
Biodiversity park is a place where all the different kinds of life can be found in one area. It is an enrichment to our society as each of the organisms work  together in the ecosystem to sustain balance of nature.
But nowadays, many of the helpless beings are on the verge of extinction due to lack of healthy environment to live in.
Hence, we have come up with the concept of aiding the endangered species by providing them with proper habitats via a database system.

#### Completed the following tasks:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Entities and Relations:</strong> Defined and established the key entities and their relationships within the ecosystem.</li>
  <li><strong>Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):</strong> Created an ERD to visually represent the entities and their interconnections.</li>
  <li><strong>Relational Schema:</strong> Developed a detailed relational schema outlining the structure of the database tables and their attributes.</li>
  <li><strong>Functional Dependencies:</strong> Identified and documented the functional dependencies to ensure data integrity.</li>
  <li><strong>Decomposition (using Normalization):</strong> Applied normalization techniques to decompose the database relations and eliminate redundancy.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation of Relational Algebra and SQL:</strong> Implemented relational algebra operations and SQL queries to interact with and manipulate the database effectively.</li>
</ul>
